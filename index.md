# Bioinformatics Spring School 2020


## About

Bioinformatics Spring School 2020 is a week long training event for researchers, supported by [Genomics Aotearoa](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz) and [NeSI](www.nesi.org.nz). 

Influenced by [The Carpentries](www.carpentries.org), we will combine talks from researchers and hands on computational workshops covering example workflows of DNA variant calling, genotyping by sequencing (GBS), RNAseq analysis, and environmental DNA (eDNA).



### When and where?

23 November - 27 November 2020

Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand


### Is this for me?

This event is designed to give researchers (including students - 4th year and above) the opportunity to learn about and practice some bioinformatic skills. We'll be covering bioinformatic workflows such as:

- DNA variant calling from next generation sequence data
- RNA sequence differential expression analysis
- Genotype by Sequencing analysis
- Environmental DNA analysis

along with computational topics such as:

- Introduction to unix commandline
- Introduction to working in a high performance computing environment (NeSI)
- Introduction to version control for code

This week long event is designed to be an immersive experience so **we ask that you commit to the entire week.** We have chosen to interleave the computational topics throughout the week so that we can build on them throughout the entire week, so this ensures participants have the key knowledge at the right time.

The underlying workhop content is extremely similar to previous workshops run by Genomics Aotearoa so if you've already attended the Genomic Data Carpentry and RNAseq workshops you will have already covered the majority of the content.
